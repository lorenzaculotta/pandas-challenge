Academy of Py - Final Report

Given the provided data on district-wide standardized test results, we can draw the following conclusions about school performance:
1.	Charter schools have higher passing rate of math and reading tests.
2.	Large school size (>2500 students) is correlated to lower tests passing rate. Students in medium and small sized schools have similar performance.
3.	Higher budget per student is correlated to poorer performances in math and reading tests.
4.	Math and reading scores are similar between the analyzed grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th).
